#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) When going through the loop you always increase by n. So your run time is O(n)


b) this is a binary search that runs O(log n)


c) This recursion performs only one action for every n. It has a runtime of O(n)

## Exercise II


Its a binary search. You would go to the middle floor and drop the egg. If it breaks you go to the middle floor between you and the ground and drop another egg. If it doesnt break you go to the middle floor between you and the roof. Follow this process and you will end up with 2 floors. One high floor where it breaks and a low floor where its safe.

I believe this is O(log n)
